The first project Nikhil (a friend of mine at Boston University) and I are looking to create is a Closed Community Advertising (CCA) site. This would essentially be modeled on Craig’s List. However, there are certain key differences. Firstly, advertising would be restricted to within a certain community. Intuition says that limiting your community would strangle your overall user base, but we decided to take a different approach. While each community may not have a large user base, we hope the benefit of advertising in such smaller closed communities would attract hundreds of such separate communities, and thus give us a large total user base.

## What is a Closed Community?

We’re defining a closed community as a community that has some barrier of entry and is generally small enough for people to be able to contact each other if they desired. Universities are a prime example of this and meet both criteria. In fact, they will be our primary focus. Some other examples of Closed Communities include: companies, small neighborhoods,charities, etc.

## What’s the Benefit of Closed Community Advertising?

The first benefit is that the users will feel more comfortable in a well established community that they are a part of. The complete anonymity offered by Craig’s List and other similar sites creates a significant amount of apprehension amongst some users. The second benefit is that Closed Communities are physically smaller. For a user to buy a couch from someone on Craig’s List, he may have to drive all the way across the city to see it, and then he has to take another trip to pick it up. For a college student using our service, he will just have to walk to the neighboring dorm or maybe even just walk to the end of the floor.

## How will ensure a Closed Community?

Email confirmation. Most every university and company has its own email addresses. All we need to do is to check that the email address belongs to the university or company. Then we simply send an email to their address requiring a confirmation. Secondly, anonymity will largely be removed. Members will have their email addresses as their user names. Finally, we will implement a user-rating system.

## Where’s the money coming from?

At first we are looking to sell advertising space. However, another idea we will want to eventually implement is the selling of list spots. Essentially, if someone searches for “furniture” you can pay money to make sure your position will always be up on top.

## Conclusions

We will start our project at Boston University. Which is luckily a huge school, and will be perfect for such a project. Nikhil is fairly confidant at being able to market this project to the Boston University student community. However, it will be a completely different game to be able to market this across the country. Also, the revenue stream is questionable, so our primary goal is to be bought out.
