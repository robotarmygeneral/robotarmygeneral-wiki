#Feedback from the Less-wrong meetup

Feb. 29th, 2011

I demoed the site briefly, and then opened it up for discussion and questions.

##General feedback

* Importing and exporting-- data portability to and from Anki, ability to import websites/wikipedia pages, etc.
* Default courses to public, and allow wiki-style crowd-sourced editing of documents.
* For text syncs, suggested pointing to a revision # and keyphrase or paragraph. Could have some way to alert user if the document had changed substantially making the sync no longer valid.
* Auto-add video syncs every 30 seconds or something (allows for card creation, etc. without a developed set of tagged notes)
* Tag-based sorting-- user tags something as an exercise, comes up as an exercise. Tag as help, shows up in help stream (example given was sakai, although feature poorly utilized-- "assignments" section, syllabus, etc., although profs just dump everything in folders under resources)
* Ability to play videos at 1.5x speed... a lot of people there apparently function at that pace, and would get bored listening to a lecture in real-time. Not sure if the youtube api supports this though; if so, it would be a cool feature.

Some ideas for content:

* Ted talks (could scrape the transcript as well, and offer that as document notes)
* Less-wrong anki deck is a good start; could also put together a "sequence" from the less-wrong site.

On the subject of the Less-wrong website, they suggested making a post in the forum asking for feedback/suggestions as well as soliciting ideas and labor for content creation.

##Networking

Luke Voss (mindviews@gmail.com, mindviews on LessWrong) was really interested in the site, and I had an extended conversation with him after the others went on to play some sort of rationality game. He had some suggestions (below), and offered to act as a "sounding board/sanity check" if we ever wanted to bounce ideas off of him or get an outside perspective.

Some of his ideas:

* Do 1-2 courses in real depth to show the power of the platform, but then throw up a wide array of different types of content to see what users latch on to before we spend more time developing courses.
* Some of his "popular appeal" courses included foreign language learning (awesome ability to tie in video!), history, trivia type stuff, memorizing shakespeare soliloquies, etc.

He also suggested we start collecting and tracking a shit ton of user data-- ie, how do users interact with the site? We ran a quick database query, and it turns out only 10 people (out of 190 users) have cards with intervals greater than 6 days-- i.e., a lot of people have maybe added some cards (or had cards auto-added), but only 10 people are using the SRS in any meaningful way. Of those 10, three were us (Ryan, Jeff, Neal). But the point is, we should track this sort of stuff, and see what users are doing on the site so we can fine-tune features, fix problems, make better tutorials, etc.

So, open question: What metrics do we want to track?

He also suggested two blogs that might be worth following:

http://steveblank.com/ -- has some interesting stuff from a business/development end (user-focused development, etc.)

http://news.ycombinator.com/ -- described as a "more refined slashdot," will likely have stories relevant to startups and projects like this.

##General feedback

* On the landing page, need some better information. Suggestion: Describe what it is (the "value proposition"), and then describe how it does it (some core features). Also, we need to update the video. Tied in to this is the so-called "SPIN" model for persuasion... describe the **situation** we are trying to solve (overcrowded classrooms, online content but no study tools, etc.), the **problem** with the current situation (self-obvious, but worth stating), the **implications** of the problem (on society, students, children, self-learners, etc.), and the solution we are offering (**needed payoff**... not sure how this part of the acronym works).
