Here’s the pitch:

Quigg is a quick way for anyone to host their own Digg-like site for any topic imaginable. Simply choose a topic, then Quigg will allow the public or invited friends to add related items that can be voted up or down. Sites with a similar ranking system to the news aggregator Digg have been sprouting up everywhere, even the [Obama administration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen's_Briefing_Book) is catching on. Now you can to!

Quigg can be used to figure out

* what to do with your friends tonight
* the best Radiohead album
* the funniest pick-up line

* and much, much more — anything you want!
This should be a quick Django warmup to get back to C2T. I think it might work better as a Facebook app, more participation, but I’ll try to get a rough version up soon.

Could be a social layer on [Shuff]()?
