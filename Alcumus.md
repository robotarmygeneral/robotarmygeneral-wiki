I use an intelligent timed flashcard program to study Chinese. That just means that it determines what to show me based on how well I’ve memorized each character.

I thought this idea would work just as well with math. Both facts and problems could show up for practice and review, and periodically the same ones will show up to give you a refresher. In theory I could use the exact same program and have math problems instead of Chinese characters, with the minor problem that I wouldn’t need to practice the same math problem as much as I would practice writing a character.

I finally checked out the new Alcumus feature on AoPS, and it’s not only stepped into my video lectures turf but it’s also jacked my new idea (somehow, from the past) and taken it a step further!

Here’s how it works. It gives you a bunch of problems from a database. The problems are organized into categories. After answering enough problems, it reports which categories you are doing well in and in which you need practice. Using this data, it determines which problem to give you next.

The video lectures are also sorted into these categories, so you can find the lectures that are specifically on your trouble areas. I think this is a very smart way to encourage watching the videos since it narrows down the large selection of videos (6 hours worth apparently) to a selection that is likely to be useful.

On top of all that, it works as a competition, with daily/monthly/all-time high scorer boards. Already some of those losers in the thousands of problems solved.

This could be a great idea to steal to merge the existing problems database application with our C2T project though the AoPS implementation is already so good I’m wondering if this might be a matter of ‘if you can’t beat them join them (and/or get addicted to their game)”.
