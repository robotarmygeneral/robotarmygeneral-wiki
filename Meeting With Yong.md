Here are the notes:

List and categorize everything
  --Facts, procedures, skills, concepts, (strategies? --fits into concept category)
  -- note, these are not hard and fast categories.


Sufficient scaffolding is important. We should be explicit when explaining things to students.

A possible philosophy in education: teaching is the process of bringing misconceptions to the surface.
Thus, response to student errors is important.

On the parse input vs. self-rating question, self-rating will a) be easier, and b) allow for more metacognitive learning.

Be able to change the granularity of the scaffolding over time--
i.e., at first we should show fully worked problems, etc., and scale back slowly to the "blank page"
prof. Jakes was talking about (which is what a student is faced with in testing situations).

Ability to flag or add a comment to a problem.

Before student starts a problem, have a textbox asking what concepts they should use. Then can self-rate.
  --In addition, have an explanation of what keywords, etc. clued you in to the particular concepts/strategies


Prof. Yong also wants to be kept updated, and is happy to give feedback/advice at any stage of the project.

Already on our Tracker tasks. ("Knowledge components")

Agrees with my research.

For thinking about it occasionally since the meeting, this seems like a powerful but still partial idea of education. E.g. a student wouldn't formulate misconceptions about algebra if never given the idea of using symbols to represent quantities.

> On the parse input vs. self-rating question, self-rating will a) be easier, and b) allow for more metacognitive learning.

I'm thinking this is where we should start. (And (c) is that we've already done it.)

Yes

Yes; less critically

I think this should be not distinct from the other things we are doing.
