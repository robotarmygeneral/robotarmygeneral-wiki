Plan: Once we get to some respectable launch state, get word out about our app and blog to a LOT of people. Hope it sticks.

There's two groups (for now): personal contacts and people with a lot of social media influence (sadly there isn't any intersection as far as I know)

Personal contacts: Send out a mass email like Prof. Evans advocated. Everyone below for the launch, * for monthly updates, ~ may need personalized message about why we are talking to them. We should also have a email form where people can sign up for updates.

*Joseph Vaughan
*Robert Cave
*Maria Klawe
*Prof. Alvarado
*Prof. Ran
*Prof. Su
*Prof. Evans
Katie Ewing 
Ha Seong Kim
Nick B from psych class
Russell Mellick
Joshua Ehrlich
Alejandro Lopez-Lago
Max Wishman
Doo Hyun Chung
Chandler May
John Reinhardt
*Marko Milosevic

Social media: Personalized emails with flattery. Chris Guillebeau advice: don't even ask to be linked, just compliment the person.

Khatzu - awesome blog for language learning (http://alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog), ideas used extensively in LS design. Does he have any suggestions about LS as immersion + SRS environment?

Chris Guillebeau - writes about how people can make money freelancing (http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/overnight-success/). Would that audience be interested in an educational platform for distributing content?

Tim Ferriss - author of current #1 NYT bestseller, loves optimizing things, should check out spaced repetition and LS (4-Hour Brain??).

Supermemo Adventures - obscure blog but will believe in our vision http://supermemoadventures.blogspot.com/

Lifehacker would also be interested in something like this (http://lifehacker.com/). Haha Just don't give them any passwords!

Cal Newport, Study Hacks dude http://calnewport.com/blog/, should want to pass this on to students. We can ask him if he thinks any other studying principles might be applied to our system. (I'll say I'm following his CS grad school + helping people learn footsteps thanks to his blog :P) 

Sal Khan (http://www.khanacademy.org/) - If we can create a course from some of his video and show how good it is, he might be interesting in working with us. (And he might be getting enough money to keep us running as a free site)

Scott H Young - http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ - big into alternative learning. even has a course on it. a partnership in order??
