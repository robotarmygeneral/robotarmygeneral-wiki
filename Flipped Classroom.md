Here's what I said about the flipped classroom in the "first step" email: 

Flipped classroom. This idea seems really promising to me, and apparently it's been a thing for a few years. The flipped classroom is letting students follow video lectures at their own pace at home and then work on problems at school, where they can get instructor & peer interaction See http://www.youtube.com/learning4mastery

Actually I guess I didn't mention it, but I first heard about it in one of the Sal Khan talks (probably the TED talk).

Same kind of crazy curve shift that was in that other article.
