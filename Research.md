# Overview

Our research involves enhancing collaborative learning and research through web resources, social networks, and other computational tools with a particular interest in domains where the knowledge base is rapidly changing so that research results directly impact learning goals. 

## Examples

* In math or science research, new results need to be evaluated and, if they are determined valid, assimilated into the knowledge of researchers. Currently, the evaluation process is primarily done through peer-review journals, and new results are presented at conferences. However, much interest has been shown in creating a faster method of publishing, using blogs and social networks to spread new results, getting help on tools like MathOverflow, and collaboratively solving problems (like [Polymath]())
* In the strategy game Starcraft 2, players research new strategies and practices primarily using the web. Players must continually learn these new ideas to stay on top of the game as it evolves.
* Programmers must constantly learn new languages and tools and update their existing knowledge when software, hardware, and other factors are updated.

From Fields Medalists to professional mathematicians to amateurs, all helped with the analysis of the claim. We were amazed at the power of the crowd in this situation.

So please, next time you discover a mathematical breakthrough (or even just a nice little theorem), please do not write it like Klaus Roth wrote his seminal 1953 article "On Certain Sets of Integers", but make it into a lively and interactive wiki, and create a computer program that tests, empirically, every single statement made in the article.

> Many of the best blog posts contain material that could not easily be published in a conventional way: small, striking insights, or perhaps general thoughts on approach to a problem. These are the kinds of ideas that may be too small or incomplete to be published, but which often contain the seed of later progress.

> The purpose of the nLab is to provide a public place where people can make notes about stuff. The purpose is not to make polished expositions of material; that is a happy by-product.

> We all make notes as we read papers, read books and doodle on pads of paper. The nLab is somewhere to put all those notes, and, incidentally, to make them available to others. Others might read them and add or polish them. But even if they don’t, it is still easier to link from them to other notes that you’ve made.

> I study how people collaborate to create content online. In my early work, I focused primarily on what people can learn through this process. The educational theory of constructionism advocates learning through working on personally meaningful projects. Can the Internet support constructionist, project-based learning?
> 
> In my newer work, I also focus on the products of online collaboration as ends in themselves. Working together, people can create new kinds of products that were not previously possible. How do we support them in this creative process, and what new kinds of collaborations might be possible? How do interaction patterns shape the final product? How do software features shape interaction patterns? How does Wikipedia really work, and why do people contribute to it? These perspectives of process and product are mutually reinforcing--people return to create new content because doing so is fulfilling to them in some way.

> Writing a book from which others can learn is itself a powerful learning experience. Based on this proposition, we have launched Science Online, a wiki to support learning in high school science classrooms through the collaborative production of an online science resource. Our approach to designing educational uses of technology is based on an approach to education called constructionism, which advocates learning by working on personally meaningful projects. Our research examines the ways that constructionism connects to collective models of knowledge production and learning such as Knowledge Building. In this paper, we explore ways that collaboration using wiki tools fits into the constructionist approach, we examine learning goals for youth growing up in a read-write culture, and we discuss preliminary findings in an ongoing year-long study of Science Online in the classroom. Despite the radically open collaboration afforded by wiki, we observe that many factors conspired to stymie collaborative writing on the site. We expected to find cultural barriers to wiki adoption in schools. Unexpectedly, we are also finding that the design of the wiki tool itself contributed barriers to collaborative writing in the classroom.

* Koedinger, Aleven - The Assitance Dilemma

* To what degree should an interactive learning environment provide students with information relevant to their learning processes and what are the most opportune moments for doing so? 
* And when is student learning supported more effectively by withholding information, either temporarily, until the student has had an opportunity to generate or synthesize the information for him or herself, or even permanently? 
* For example, what is the appropriate balance between passive examples versus problem solving? 
* Should students be given explanations or asked to generate them themselves? 
* Should feedback in interactive systems be immediate (providing timely information) or delayed (withholding information to a later time)? 
* Should instructional hints be more specific or more general? 
* Should they provide informative descriptions of principles or examples that the student can use to infer those principles themselves? 
* Should information or problems on the same knowledge be placed close together (providing the student with assistance in retrieving information from one problem to the next) or spaced more widely (withholding easy information carry-over from one problem to the next)? 
* Under what circumstances is guided problem solving more effective than (pure or guided) discovery learning?


# Topics

## Spread of knowledge on a social network

like Facebook but going for *useful* knowledge -- how can current array of tools (Twitter, blogs, FB/G+) be improved? Also look at the social dynamics of (web) communities that work on collaborative learning and/or research

* scientific questions: relative quickness of ideas spreading in various media?
* computational tools: improvements to social aspects of [Learnstream Soup]()
* cognitive aspects: deciding to share something, deciding to pay attention to something

## Tying learning tools into collaborative research

how to peel off the things that need practice and/or memorization? (e.g. definitions can be memorized effectively with SRS); how does knowledge from the collaboration transfer to learning

* scientific questions: do generic practices work as well for topic X as for topic Y? 
* computational tools: [Learnstream Glue]()
* cognitive aspects: 

## Collaborative problem solving

investigate and improve upon efforts like [Polymath](), optimize allocation of effort, improve motivation 

* scientific questions: 
* tools: improve on polymath
* cognitive aspects: cognitive load of on-going activity, motivation

## Web video

* scientific questions: is using video to learn effective?
* tools: along the lines of Learnstream
* cognitive aspects: cognitive load of video content

## Scaffolded problem solving

* scientific questions: does it work?
* tools: extending quiz-embedded videos in [Learnstream Atomic]()
* cognitive aspects: cognitive load of problem 

## Spaced repetition for learning

explore how to use spaced repetition for more than just simple facts

* cognitive aspects: what is the basis for the effectiveness of "triggering" (if this really exists)?

## Storing educational material 

One foundational aspect of all of these topics is how the underlying knowledge content is stored. Can we improve the efficiency of various tools by finding a better way to represent the information? Some ideas: breaking up a topic into knowledge components expressed as questions, creating a DSL that allows ideas to be stored as variables and procedures (Also, think about implications of having educational material in a procedural form -- like in [Mindstorms](), it could be used for simulations to build intuition)

* tools: tool for creating a database of knowledge content, tool for retrieving information from the database
