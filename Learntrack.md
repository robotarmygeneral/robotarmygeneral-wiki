Here's a cool little web-based quiz on CSS: http://net.tutsplus.com/quizzes/nettuts-quiz-1-beginner-css/

Too bad the results aren't stored somewhere and the knowledge SRS'd. 

Clearly, they need to be using Learntrack, which lets websites embed their own quizzes. The results are tracked for each Learntrack user. Users can log into Learntrack to figure out what they need to review and then head back to those sites to do so. Everyone wins!

Learntrack solves one of the fundamental problems with Learnstream: trying to get content into a centralized place. Now we let other sites worry about the content-making and give their users very nice features. Users can also create their own quizzes, which are just linked back to the original content.
