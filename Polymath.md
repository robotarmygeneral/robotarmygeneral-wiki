# Design

* Nested comments in chronological order
* Wiki for keeping track of higher level organization

# Complaints

* Hard to see all latest comments (since they might be nested somewhere)
* Hard to follow everything going on
* Breaks concentration out of work flow
* Having a way to draw would be nice
