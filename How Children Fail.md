Some students are intelligent in many aspects of their lives, but as soon as they enter the classroom they turn into dolts.

Observation: students that are failing at the beginning of the year are still failing at the end. Efforts to make class interesting/engaging usually result in good students staying good/getting better, and bad students staying bad/getting worse.

The challenge is not to get students to ask about what they don't know, it's to get them to realize the difference between the stuff they understand and the stuff they don't.

Strategies students use:

    mumble answers
    guess and look
    take a wild guess and see what happens
    get the teacher to answer his/her own questions

School has conditioned children to "get the right answer by any means". This means that students often arrive at "correct" answers without understanding the material; for example, the teacher asks them a hard question and they don't answer, so the teacher asks them a series of easier leading questions until they arrive at the answer, often without real understanding. Children have a surprising number of these "coping" strategies which they use to game the system.

Interesting observation: playing a "20 questions" game to guess a number between 1 and 10,000, students might ask "is it greater than 5,000?" and be really excited if the answer is "yes", but really dismayed if the answer is "no" even though they both offer the same amount of information. This is a result of poor education/schooling, where the emphasis is on getting correct answers as opposed to learning from incorrect ones.

First section thoughts: Holt really seems to be implying that the psychology of the classroom is analagous to game theory. Students are there to "win" the "game", and choose strategies that get them the least ridicule from their classmates or the most "correct!" answers from their teachers. The goal is not to understand the material, but to avoid being the focus of attention or to only answer things they (kind of) know the answer to. Often times, the "winning strategy" is to say nothing at all, and most teachers (even experienced ones) don't realize their students are gaming the system.

Teachers don't realize that they are the source of poor thinking/problem solving techniques, not math or reading or science. Students develop strategies to cope with the problems we present, and often the emphasis is not on the material but on the evaluation we offer. Hence, the coping strategies try to maximize positive evaluations and minimize negative ones, not maximize understanding. Also, teachers often do not approach their work from a rigorous scientific perspective, where they test new strategies and discard ones that don't work.
