##Executive Summary

At Xun Solutions, we seek to provide premier educational tools with a focus on online learning. The e-learning industry is estimated at \$56 billion, with a few large players offering software solutions to established educational institutions and corporations. In other words, the only consumer access to e-learning products is through one of these restricted entities, such as colleges that offer online courses or training programs associated with one’s employer. Currently, there are very few sites that offer both hosted content and a learning platform to anyone wanting access to online education. This represents a new market with no established leader, and Xun Solutions aims to capitalize on this opportunity to become the dominant leader in online learning through its exciting web application, Learnstream. 

Learnstream is a web-based learning platform that offers several key features to improve learning over current online study solutions, giving us reason to believe it will become the primary online destination for independent learners. As it stands, the internet contains a vast amount of information but there is currently no systematic way to go about studying and learning that material. Learnstream leverages this content, both in the form of premium courses offered by our partners and in the form of freely available “open courseware,” to offer an enhanced, interactive learning environment for life-long students.

Educational content on the Learnstream platform is presented within a sophisticated but friendly user interface. Typical content will include video lectures and text-based notes that are displayed in sync with the video. Adding content and syncing notes is easy for the course creator, and students can easily enroll in any number of courses to access this content. 

The unique draw of Learnstream, beyond its intuitive interface and quality educational content, is the highly effective study tools demonstrated to boost understanding and retention. The substantial value added by these study tools is where Learnstream truly differentiates itself from content-only companies. Learnstream employs a psychologically-proven method to determine when core concepts should be studied for optimal learning, and provides easy links back to the original text and video for further clarification. Users will be encouraged to return to the site daily to keep up with their automatically scheduled reviews and learn new material. Since the study tools ensure that students only spend their time reviewing concepts that are difficult or likely to be forgotten, we believe the site will be particularly appealing to independent learners with time constraints.

Learnstream is an ideal tool for learners functioning outside of the formal education system and is applicable to learning a wide variety of skills.  While there is no limit to what can be taught on the Learnstream platform, we will initially target high-demand subjects such as SAT/ACT/GRE test preparation, computer skills, and foreign language learning.
As with other companies that cater to independent learners, students would pay for premium content offered by our partners. The diverse course offerings will be delivered to the user in a way analogous to the iPhone App Store. This model allows third-party content providers, such as existing educational companies and websites, universities, and independent educators, to offer their content on the Learnstream platform.  Prospective students will be able to browse the courses, read a summary of the content, and view ratings of the course from other users. If they choose to purchase the course, users will pay the amount set by the third-party content provider and Learnstream will take a percentage of the sale price. This model has seen astounding success in the context of the iOS development platform, in part due to the freedom it offers content providers in setting their own price. Xun Solutions will function as a facilitator to help these educators disseminate and market their courses to a wider audienc, while at the same time providing enhanced tools for students to learn the course material.

In the first year, we expect to partner with several large content providers and additionally attract many smaller educators to adopt Learnstream as their content distribution source. The exposure provided by Learnstream will strategically position Xun Solutions as a trusted technology provider for brick and mortar institutions transitioning to web-hosted content as well as new online educational offerings in the next several years. 


##Background and Purpose of Venture

Xun Solutions is a company started by students at Harvey Mudd College, an institution known for its emphasis on high-quality teaching and learning. The founding team is driven by a passion for learning, and our vision is to apply modern technology in creative ways to enhance the method for education and personal development. With an increasing demand for education in modern society, Xun Solutions seeks to provide logistically favorable means of satisfying the intellectual curiosity of society.  By making all forms of education more accessible to the general public Xun Solutions will change how people view the attainment of knowledge and skill sets.

##Management Team

Xun Solutions is comprised of a small team of driven members with a strong technical background.  CEO Nicole Crisosto has considerable experience in pure research operations and has been involved in an additional web-based start up. Product design and technical development is led by our CTO Ryan Muller, who has several years of experience in programming, web development, and education technology. He will continue to have an active role in the development of the Learnstream platform. Erin Partlan, our CFO, handles the company finances and has extensive background in both mathematics and economics. Our Sales & Marketing efforts are headed by Neal Pisenti and Jeffrey Burkert. Neal has extensive experience in education and will continue to serve as an ambassador to our advises in academia and to companies and private educators to facilitate content acquisition. With a unique perspective from poker, Jeffrey has developed and continues to foster methods of product sales. As the company continues to grow, additional management personnel will be sought. 

##Products and Services

Learnstream will begin as a web application that can be accessed through our website, Learnstream.org, which centrally hosts the application and educational content. We will also provide applications on mobile devices (such as the iPhone, iPad, and Android) and social media sites to lower the barriers in accessing content. Additionally, taking advantage of social networking sites will provide interesting avenues for marketing.

Content is organized into courses. Each course has an activity feed that displays content updates and questions from the course members. Courses consist of many documents containing text and videos. Learnstream features synchronization between the text notes and video, so the document scrolls according to the time of the video. The user can also scroll through the document and select a segment to play.  

Content providers will also provide study cards that are automatically managed by the Learnstream system. When the user encounters a new concept, they can add the instructor’s cards to the review scheduling system. They also have the option to create their own cards.

While studying, the student can review the context of a particular concept in the notes by replaying the corresponding part of the video. The synergy between textual notes and video offers an extra dimension to one’s ability to review material presented in a video lecture, as confusing or fast-paced explanations can be watched and read multiple times until the concept is fully understood. We envision a core set of notes synced to the instructor’s video, with the additional capability for students to add their own notes, thoughts, and questions on top of the course material.

Spaced Repetition.  Research into the learning process has long established the principle that students retain material better when it is reviewed several times over a longer period than when it is reviewed in a “massed study” over a short period of time. Roughly speaking, when reviews are spaced out over longer intervals, we force our brain to recall and sometimes relearn a concept during the review. In doing so, the concept becomes reinforced more strongly in our memory and we are less likely to forget it in the future. However, when faced with a large amount of material, it is difficult to know the optimal review time for each particular item. Spaced repetition algorithms like the one built into Learnstream are designed to manage one’s understanding of some set of material and force the student to review concepts just as they start to slip from memory. Additionally, the contextual syncing between study review cards and the original material provides an easy way for students to view the original content if they are confused.

Incremental learning. When presented with a long text or video lecture, a user may not be able or willing to read and/or watch it entirely in one sitting. Incremental learning allows the student to save their location in a lecture or video, and when they return later they are presented with a set of concept questions to help recall the context of the argument where they left off. This has two benefits: first, it allows the student to pick up seamlessly after a break, but secondly and perhaps more importantly it reinforces the material they have already learned. Pedagogically, dividing readings into segments with small breaks in between promotes comprehension and minimizes fatigue. This feature is also extremely appealing to people who may be working with limited time resources.

Student analytics.  Students who actively maintain their Learnstream study programs will establish both recall-likeliness and item-difficulty estimates for each learned item. Instructors can use this information to assess which concepts may need to be further reviewed in another lecture, and how much their students are struggling with specific parts of the material. Although we claim to enhance the ability of a student to study, there’s no substitute for an instructor’s insight in providing clarity or meaning to individual items. We think that instructors will be able to use the system as a diagnostic tool to help figure out where their attention is best spent in improving the course. Our model currently supports both recall-likeliness and item-difficulty outputs, but it will require continued research to improve our ability to assess and apply this information. Ultimately, this feature can develop into additional premium content offerings where instructors provide personalized feedback to students.

Social features.  In addition to the active learning facilitated by the spaced review system, Learnstream also improves engagement and interaction on the site through social features. Students are able to pose questions to a “help feed,” tag specific problems or sections of the course material with questions, and communicate with each other for group studying. Instructors can also use the site to directly answer student questions. We will use Facebook as an inspiration for an interface that students are familiar with and want to use.

##Technology

The site back-end is programmed in Python using the Django web framework and a PostgreSQL database to store course documents and information about user study. Video content is served through our web host using HTML5 video. Video syncing and study tool mechanics are performed with Javascript. 

##Revenue and Marketing Model

Learnstream will be marketed to users on a centralized website that delivers content through a model similar to the iPhone app store.  Users will be able to browse courses provided by third-party content providers and view information such as course reviews and ratings.  If a user decides to purchase a course, they will be given access to the content through the Learnstream platform.  Xun Solutions will take a 25% commission off of each sale and the rest will go to the third party content provider.  Like the iPhone app store, we will allow the content providers to set their own prices. For example, The Teaching Company currently sells DVDs consisting of twenty-four half-hour lectures for \$250, or approximately \$10 per half-hour video.  We expect most Learnstream courses to be priced in that range, though there will likely be significant variation depending on length and perceived quality of a course.

##Courses and Content

The versatility of Learnstream’s platform allows us to target a wide array of course offerings and potential learning markets. However, we plan to focus initially on two key market areas: job skill training with a particular emphasis on skills for freelance workers, and test preparation courses for standardized tests like the SAT/ACT, GRE, MCAT, and LSAT. Future market directions, however, include marketing Learnstream directly to businesses for employee training and to institutions of higher education to both supplement their brick and mortar operations and enhance their online offerings.

###Job Skill Training

In the evolving workforce, there are always people looking to either retrain themselves to be more competitive or to learn new skills that will help them in their current job capacity. This is particularly true today in a down economy. From an employer’s perspective, there is an increasing demand for workers trained in several high-tech skills such as programming and software development. This market need has been realized by many companies that provide online training courses catered to these 21st century job skills. Xun Solutions aims to target these companies with Learnstream, offering them a wider distribution network in addition to our study tools which enhance the learning experience.

One such company, Lynda.com, offers over 900 courses (with over 40,000 training videos) on subjects ranging from web design to programming languages to CAD software to digital video and photo editing. They receive over 20 million visitors to their site each year. Course authors/instructors are paid to create content, and receive royalties based on the popularity of their courses. Their user base includes students, adults in the workforce trying to learn a new skill for job promotion, and companies such as Time Warner and Patagonia that want to keep their employees on the forefront of design applications.

In addition to Lynda.com, there are an enormous number of tutorial videos available online, representing both free and premium content, that target a similar freelance or life-learner market. Xun Solutions plans to aggressively advertise the Learnstream platform to the experts currently producing these tutorials, giving them a centralized distribution platform which both enhances the quality and reach of their material. We will solicit content from such independent instructors, and plan to offer at least 250 free and premium courses at launch.

###Test Preparation

The recent increase in college competitiveness has created a corresponding increase in the number of parents and students seeking SAT/ACT prep courses. The test preparation industry is estimated at \$4 billion dollars. One test-prep company, Kaplan, charges between \$500 and \$1,300 for offline SAT prep classes. Another, Princeton Review, offers a variety of online SAT, ACT, and GRE prep courses priced at around \$300. A third, AllPencilsDown, offers online classes at \$250. None of these content providers, however, offer the complete suite of study tools provided by Learnstream. We will seek partnerships with Kaplan and Princeton Review, the dominant players in the test-prep industry, to offer content on our platform. In addition, we are currently pursuing contacts at AllPencilsDown to offer their test preparation courses on our platform.

Ultimately, the advantage Learnstream has over any individual content provider is twofold. First, we offer novel tools on our study platform that greatly enhance the learning experience. This is not being done anywhere else in a way that is comparable to the extent and integration featured by Learnstream. But second and perhaps more importantly, by aggregating content from across the web we provide a single destination for learners. This boosts the exposure of smaller, independent content providers and also allows us to expand to other more specialized markets. Some examples might include people wanting to learn to play poker (where content could be provided in partnership with sites such as CardRunners and Deuces Cracked), pick up a new hobby, or learn any other skills. The flexibility of Learnstream paired with the diversity of interests on the web means a potentially large and expanding market for content offered on our system. And the centralized location for this content allows learners to rate, preview, and buy the best courses available anywhere online without having to painstakingly search across multiple sites. With Learnstream, Xun Solutions aims to lower the barriers for independent learners to access content and provide a trusted name in online education.

##Distribution and Marketing

Learnstream is a tool initially targeted at the lifelong learner who may not have access to the resources of a formal educational institution.  While traditional academic subjects can be delivered through the Learnstream interface, the most promising starting applications of the technology are in subjects typically learned outside the confines of academia.  Examples include standardized exam preparation, foreign language learning, and computer skill development.  The test preparation market alone is estimated to be at \$4 billion.  Even a niche market such as the online poker education industry generates revenues in the \$10 million range.  There is clearly a very large market selling to independent and Learnstream is poised

For Learnstream to be a truly effective learning platform, it is important that we offer a wide array of courses at launch.  This way, it will be possible for users to organize a potentially diverse set of learning needs on a single centralized platform.  Thus, it is important to the viability of Learnstream to form lasting content partnerships with existing educational content providers in a variety of fields. This will not only allow Learnstream to offer a variety of content, but will allow us to leverage the advertising networks of these content providers to publicize Learnstream. In these partnerships, Learnstream will be able to reach a wide range of people who are already interested in independent, online learning.

Learnstream will form two types of content partnerships, one featuring free content, and one featuring premium content. Free content will come from sources such as MIT OpenCourseWare and non-profit organizations wanting to do community education around particular issues (such as personal finance).  These partnerships will be facilitated by the fact that many such organizations already provide their content under a Creative Commons license that allows us to use it for this purpose.  Having the free content on the site will also allow users to try the platform before buying an expensive course. Additionally, it expands our user base beyond just paying users to make Learnstream a more valuable and better-known resource for all learners.

In addition to forming partnerships with nonprofit sources, Learnstream will have some commercial partners so that the site can generate revenue starting at launch.  While forming these partnerships will be more challenging, there are several aspects of Learnstream that will prove attractive to content providers.  The most attractive feature to content providers is how Learnstream technology will maximize the value of their content.  Unlike other content providers, partners will have the opportunity to interact with the developers of Learnstream to tailor the presentation of their content specifically for the Learnstream platform.  Additionally, early content will start with disproportionately more traffic and reviews, so there is a distinct advantage for companies to partner early. Additionally, Xun Solutions is considering commission discounts for partners that provide content at launch. Once the site is launched, Xun Solutions will continue to seek out content partners and to encourage other providers to upload content themselves in order to increase sales. 

In order for Learnstream to be successful, it must have a large user base. While marketing through content providers is effective, Xun Solutions plans to use a social marketing campaign to reach additional groups. Prior to launch, Learnstream will make press releases to both traditional news sources and prominent blogs related to technology and education.  The innovative nature of the Learnstream approach to learning will make it an easy and compelling story for bloggers to write about. Additionally, a walkthrough of the site is available on YouTube and as a free course on Learnstream itself to give users a preview of the Learnstream concept.  Once on the site, users will be able to test out the platform using the free content and see the compelling nature of this technology firsthand. 

##Competition and Risks

Counting both online educators and software developers, e-learning is a \$5.6 billion industry. We classify competitors in this industry into three main categories. The first is software providers who deploy e-learning software (often called learning management systems) to institutions such as corporations or schools. Most often, this content cannot be accessed except by those employed by or enrolled at one of the institutions who license the software. Since we will not initially target these institutions, we do not consider the first category as a major competitors, but we hope that our model will eventually encourage companies to move towards Learnstream and away from closed silos of educational content. 

The second category of competitors are websites that offer study tools for anyone who signs up but do not themselves provide content, instead allowing each user to aggregate their own content (and possibly share with others). Major sites in this category include OpenStudy, smart.fm, StudyBlue, and Kloofers. There also exist offline software with similar spaced-repetition review scheduling systems, including Supermemo and Anki. 

Finally, the competitors most similar to us include those who provide both study tools and free and paid educational content without a fixed learning domain. This is a new and small market, but emerging contenders include Udemy, Nixty, and Academic Earth. However, none of these provide tools to match the sophistication of Learnstream.

The largest risk to Learnstream is failing to land partnerships with established user bases or having partnerships that do not substantially direct traffic to the Learnstream interface. We believe that since Learnstream provides value-added features to any existing content, and also provides a method that draws users to return daily, content providers will be willing to adapt Learnstream as their primary distribution platform.

##Defensibility and Intellectual Property

We are currently investigating the patentability of Learnstream’s suite of study tools. However, we recognize that in the online industry things often move quickly. We currently have a prototype of our product, and have invested significant time thinking about and planning the pedagogical interplay of various aspects of the Learnstream platform. Thus, we believe we have a substantial lead over any potential competitors in the market, and plan to take advantage of this in moving quickly to a dominant position. Thus, speed to market will be our greatest asset in securing our position as the key player in online education.

##Financial Information

Our financial predictions are based on the revenue model discussed above, with a 25% commission on purchased courses and the average course costing \$100 for 10 lectures. For generating partnerships with initial content providers, the commission will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis, and is expected to fall between 10% and 25%, depending on the reputation and sales volume of the company. With the 250 premium courses we plan to have at the time of launch, we anticipate first-year sales of roughly 2,000 courses per month. Assuming an average of 10 videos per course, this amounts to \$600,000 in revenue off commissions in the first year. We expect that our sales will grow quickly as additional partnerships and users are added, and keeping in line with the experience of other web-based startups we aim for sales during this growth period to double each year. In our fifth year, we expect an annual revenue of \$4,000,000.

In order to bring Learnstream to launch, we will develop an improved interface, add social functionality, and create a customer service system. We plan to hire employees for programming, developing content partnerships, sales and marketing to users, bookkeeping, and general office management. Our largest startup cost is the purchase of computing equipment, and our major recurring costs include hosting and bandwidth as well as legal fees. With funding of one million dollars, we will have the resources to accomplish this and achieve profitability after two years. Our first tier investors would own 18% of the company at the time of IPO, which we hope to accomplish within five years. For an assumed P/E ratio of 20 - 25, an investment of one million now would result in 10x return on investment at the time of IPO.


##Sales and Marketing Budget

While we expect to leverage the existing network of our content providers, part of the advantage offered by Learnstream is the potential of a wide-ranging, trusted distribution network for online learning material. Thus, we will require dedicated employees to work on marketing campaigns (both traditional and viral) to spread awareness of Learnstream’s content and enhanced study tools. The marketing team will maintain our web presence through social sites such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, as well as promote the company by posting in blogs and forums. Our sales team will be in charge of obtaining partnerships and recruiting free content providers. Employee costs (per year) in both sales and marketing are shown in the table below, assuming an annual salary of \$70,000.

S&M Employees, per year
Year 1	Year 2	Year 3	Year 4	Year 5
Sales	2	4	4	6	8
Marketing	2	2	4	6	8
Total Salaries	\$280,000  	\$420,000	\$560,000 	\$940,000 	\$1,230,000



As the company grows, we will invest in sponsorships to both advertise Learnstream as well as promote the company’s reputation. We will allocate \$100,000 in the fourth year and increase this budget by 10% in each year following for this purpose.

##Future Plans

Once Learnstream is launched, it will attract current independent learners as a platform for organizing the material that they are learning. This demographic will create the critical user mass that will propagate the continued addition of new users and content. Not only do these users serve as an example of how Learnstream could be used, they would also be well-suited for using the site in its beta stage to assist with debugging. The user base will also influence new content providers, thus increasing the value of Learnstream as a hub for online education. With sufficient resources for marketing and management, Xun Solutions will be able to provide the customer support necessary to keep Learnstream operating smoothly. As Learnstream becomes established, Xun Solutions will continue to improve the site with added functionality, such as support for different languages that will allow Learnstream to reach even larger markets and eventually cater to a global audience. 

As Learnstream is a platform for content, there is no limit to its future applications.  While it is currently being geared towards independent learners, as Learnstream grows, new forms of content will be supported.  This may include (but is not limited to) forms of accreditation, academic courses, and corporate training applications.


##Conclusion

Learnstream represents a novel and synergistic combination of several tools in online education. Our pedagogical approach has support from psychology literature, and there is reason to believe the Learnstream platform offers substantial improvement in learning outcomes over current online education solutions. Our method for content distribution, modeled off of the iPhone App Store, will bolster the variety of courses we offer and ultimately lead to a larger user draw and create higher value for both content providers and our investors. The initial target markets, job skill training and test preparation, are both burgeoning and will provide a solid foundation from which Xun Solutions can expand.
