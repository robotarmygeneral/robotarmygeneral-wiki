The posthumously titled "initial" Learnstream iteration that was used for the spring 2011 Real Analysis course. The application intended to combine everything in one, resulting in an unwieldy user interface. However, it provided food for thought on using SRS for advanced material, handling student participation on the web, and compiling web resources.

Here's the general idea: Everything you want to learn, remember, see more than once in your life is put into a spaced repetition system, separated out into different courses. Each of these items--often in the form of a question--will be enhanced by comments from yourself or shared by other people who are also "SRSing" the item. These can link to documents within the web app and even pull up specific paragraphs and videos. We tried to emphasize documents that serve to enhance video lectures with transcripts or chalkboard text typed out. Furthermore, questions and other types of items can be shared to a course feed so that instructors and other students can answer the question or choose to review the same question.  

Where to go from here?

* If SRS is even going to work for more abstract and difficult material, it needs to be carefully developed. This was the primary thrust of [Learnstream Atomic]().
* StackOverflow is the top of the game for getting questions answered in a social place. During Soup development, we discussed the possibility of tying together its interface with tools for lecture and review. This is analogous to what OpenStudy is trying to do with MIT OCW and several other sources. But OpenStudy is no StackOverflow, and it also ignores the review element.
* Soup taught us that sticking all three of learning, reviewing, and discussing in a single interface is probably overwhelming, but having them all in click's range would be nice.
