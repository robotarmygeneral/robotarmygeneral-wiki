* User gets questions from a virtual teacher
* Can either answer the question or get a hint that is randomly generated from saved logs (and which may or may not be correct)

Enhance with NLP, mechanical turk, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms (must have quantitative evaluation metrics)

May fold into a Learnstream iteration if deemed worthy.
