* Educational video portal -- notes too!
* School Remix: decide what video to watch or read or do to get your education ([Learnstream Glue]() lite)
* Scaffolded problem solving tool
* YASRS (yet another spaced repetition system) maybe with card sharing and/or various small generation tools (like StudyEgg; possibly using services like Wolfram Alpha or dictionaries for second language learning) and/or integration with Twitter etc.
* Google+ wrapper for virtual school ([Learnstream Plus]() lite)
* Educational content database
* Khan Academy companion -- scheduling, repetition, social features
* DSL for programmable curriculum
* Hypothesis testing with simulations (like Turtle)
* Students teach each other in a game-like environment (possibly drawing from [the jigsaw technique](http://www.jigsaw.org/))

* Student-created course: The instructor may provide a short video to motivate the section. Students are assigned into teams to complete parts of the section by finding video and text sources, recording their own video, creating questions for the class, etc. The other students can then ask questions and add ideas to the produced document. Finally, the instructor can offer a concluding video and designate some cards as Concept Cards (Some of these will be simple reviews; others may be deeper questions that are answered later in the course. Either way, they're all in the SRS!)
* Teach-to-learn: The instructor provides an initial set of progressive questions whose answers constitute a good understanding of the subject. Students are responsible for researching and answering questions in a highly expository way. The instructor can periodically check in to make sure progress is going well. Grade is based on the points given for being helpful!
; GoogleWave classroom: bot for SRS interaction ; aggregate content on site for instructors and students through wave ; use wave for documents, select sections to convert to SRS ; students use playback to see graders comments ; instructors use playback to grade collaborations ; collaboratively take notes during lecture ; parse LaTeX etc with bots ; use bots for interactive educational things (make graphs, educational games, etc) ; use bots to assist in problem solving (wavealpha, etc)
* StackOverflow wrapper with lectures and other basic educational pieces that are discussed via the questions
* Combining faded examples with community collaboration: If a student doesn’t understand a certain step, or thinks there is a different high-level concept which would be equivalent/better, then they can flag a particular problem and/or step for the community and/or TA’s. This then auto-creates a discussion pad similar to openstudy (or even at open study…?), where community members can weigh in.  We could also implement something a la stack exchange, where community members with enough street cred have limited admin powers to augment worked examples by showing alternative methods?
