For learning [math](Computerizing Math), students do their own proofs, but these are heavily hinted and scaffolded using our tool, which:

* Hyperlinks definitions in theorem statement or in student's answer (use existing knowledge database?)
* Handles computations, graphings, etc. 
* Provides "templates" that fill in parts of the proof or definitions; perhaps leaving blanks to be filled in with steps or numbers
* Can also be used with unsolved problems and to output presentations, papers, etc.
