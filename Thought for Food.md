# The Idea

# The Mechanics

## Registered Users

All points earned by registered users will be tracked. All registration will require is a working email address. Weekly and monthly winners will be announced. If enough money is earned, prizes will be given to the winners. Eventually, team competition will be put in place. Winners will be emailed and will have to respond with a name and address for prize delivery. Competitions will be limited to difficulty level, so sixth graders will not be competing against grad students.

## Answering Questions

Answering questions will accumulate points which will translate to food. The more questions answered the more food for the hungry. Harder questions will earn more points.

## Question Formation

Questions will be submitted by users themselves, or, for simpler subjects (such as vocabulary and arithmetic), formed by an algorithm. Users will choose a subject, and then formulate a question. As all questions will be multiple-choice, users will also have to provide 4 (3?) wrong answers. Questions will be randomized.

## Supplying Questions

Supplying a question will earn points for the registered user who created if it is accepted. Users will also earn a “royalty” on questions, depending on a formula of how many people answered the question correctly versus how many missed it. It will thus be in the user’s interest to create well-rounded questions that are not phased out. All questions will be screened by moderators before being accepted. Registered users will also be able to report questions if they find them dubious. If a question is revoked, the user who contested it will earn points.


# Question Categories

Questions categories will be sorted into four general difficulty groups. Level I will be primarily for elementary and middle school students. Level II will be for middle and high school students. Level III will be for high school students and undergrads. Level IV will be for undergrads and above.

Note: Categories with (alg) by them will be formed by an algorithm and not user submitted questions.

## Level I

1.	Vocabulary I  (alg)
2.	Arithmetic (alg)
3.	Geography I
4.	American History I
5.	World History I
6.	Algebra I (alg)

## Level II

1.	Algebra II
2.	Geometry I
3.	Trigonometry I
4.	Pre-Calculus
5.	Literature I
6.	American History II
7.	World History II
8.	Biology I
9.	Physics I
10.	Chemistry I
11.	 Grammar I
12.	 Vocabulary II

## Level III

1.	Calculus I
2.	Geometry II
3.	Trigonometry II
4.	European Literature I
5.	American Literature I
6.	Biology II
7.	Physics II
8.	Chemistry II
9.	Grammar II
10.	American History III
11.	European History I
12.	Latin I
13.	Vocabulary III
14.	Computer Science I

## Level IV

1.	Multi-variable Calculus
2.	Linear Algebra
3.	Discrete Systems
4.	Computer Science [something]
5.	Philosophy 101
6.	Microeconomics
7.	Macroeconomics

Note: I’m worried I complicated this too much. But I think it’s necessary to split the categories up.




# The Money (and Food)


We hope that the popularity of this site will mimic the success of both our inspirations. The money will come strictly from advertising, which will fund our donations. We will start with Adword and similar advertisers, and hope that larger ones will hop on-board. Despite our humanitarian goals, we must shut down the site if it is operating at a lost. If this occurs, we will try to sell the code and/or site.


# Conclusions

It is our greatest hope that this site will succeed. Our main problem will be attracting a dedicated initial user base, which is necessary for all user-perpetuated communities. Our second obstacle will be to attract sponsors. If both conditions are met, we hope the competitive aspect of the site will keep it running long after the initial novelty ceases. If successful, the site could generate great humanitarian success, as well as a large intellectual community.
