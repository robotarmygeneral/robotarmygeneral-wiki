> This is basically the Heisig method for Chinese or Japanese characters, which goes perfectly with the Learnstream cards (I have over 1700 of them). It's a bit more complex for characters than a simple mediator -- instead it builds up from multiple components of the character. I think that idea could be applied to more complex things too, as long as the dependent components are learned first. (In Art of Memory, memorization of long, complex stuff is performed with big, intricate architectural structures, could be considered along the same lines. Neal and I briefly discussed doing some kind of geometric SRS but haven't thought too deeply about it.)
