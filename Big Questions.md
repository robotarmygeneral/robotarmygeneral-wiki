How do we learn things?

How should classes be taught? See Learning philosophies

How can we utilize the tools of the web to improve learning? How can we take advantage of collective intelligence for collaborative learning? 

What should be taught to people in today's world? (See some my ideas at How to Pwn course) How can we make an "evolving curriculum" that captures the quickly changing world and involves conversations among those who are making the changes?

We want to be able to break new ideas to learnable ideas. The way a lot of things are learned is through exercises: 1+1 = ?, but new things don't come with exercises. An observation: asking questions and knowing what you don't know is one of the hardest things. Is there any way to automate breaking down the source of failure that comes from gaps in knowledge or understanding?

How does a post-Watson world affect human learning? (Where post-Watson is defined as reasonably good NLP)
