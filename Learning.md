Mostly a linkfest for now. Note that, as in any scientific work, the hypotheses can be based on flawed experimentation or apply only in specific conditions or domains, which I may not have necessarily tried to reproduce in my one-liners. Please add and discuss! I'll try to compile on a wiki or something eventually.

Children ought to be educated humanely, being first exposed to the beauty and usefulness of the subject rather than starting with testing standards and drills (Papert, Lockhart)

Understanding how learning works can help improve learning (Medina)

Working memory can be improved

# Unsorted ideas

* Teaching others is effective (Koedinger - teaching SimStudent, Cal Newport)
* "All Japanese children speak Japanese" (Suzuki, Khatzumoto) - the implication is that some set of conditions make learning "automatic"
* Learning something new requires making it extremely simplified and repeating it many times (Deb Roy TED talk, Suzuki)
* Importance of timing and rate of change (Suzuki) - overlaps with [Productivitiy]()
* Idea of the 80/20 principle and minimum effective dose to make learning more efficient - overlaps with [Productivity]()
* "Delayed feedback", such as you would get in many videogames, is not effective (Aleven)
* Why does categorizing things help us understand them?
* How do we actually create new knowledge -- Meno's paradox, Sweller paper:
> employ a ver- sion of means-ends analysis in which differences between a current problem-state and goal-state are identified and problem-solving operators are found to reduce those differences
* Worked example instruction http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475206000181 
* The importance of pattern recognition; how do we handle big, abstract patterns?
* Cognitive load, focusing on one possibility at a time -- can anything useful along these lines be taught?
* Developing intuition: how does it happen? how long does it take? (Can't be 10000 hours for *everything*)
* Learning styles don't exist http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIv9rz2NTUk

> This was one of the failures of lecture-based freshman physics. For most students, they’d never had to utilize “expert” techniques during high school. The formulas were all they needed. As a result, lectures that professors delivered which seemed clear and carefully thought out were perceived in an entirely different light by their students, who had yet to develop the problem-solving skills and advanced reasoning that the lecturer took for granted. Research supports this; Wieman points out that it has been shown that even when looking at a simulation on a computer screen, students “literally see different things happening… than do the experts. As a result, the student can interpret what is shown very differently from what was intended, and learn incorrect ideas.”
