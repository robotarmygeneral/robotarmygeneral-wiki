# Introduction

People do a lot of learning by reading, and usually there is little to assist in that process. Improving reading (for the purpose of learning, rather than say pleasure) ties into the whole learning process, so there is some overlap. Here are some possibilities for using technology to make reading better:

* Pulling up the most useful information from a variety of sources and displaying it in the most easily readable fashion
* Helping review prerequisites before reading a particular piece
* Bookmarking, remembering, or sharing extractions from a text
* Assisting in speed-reading
