Our main moneymaker is one-on-one consulting. A potential client tells us they want to excel at a particular game. Mostly rich kids who want to stick it to their friends. Our expert team of researchers play the game and figure out how to win, or we just dig up old research on it. For PC games, we can use something like GoToMyPC to directly comment on the customer's technique.

All of the ideas we develop in the research can be organized and put up on Learnstream as paid lessons to draw in some extra money.

To attract customers, we also put some content up on a blog or podcast. There are plenty of gaming news sites, but I don't know of anything that focuses entirely on strategy for a wide range of games. Gaming needs its own Lifehacker, 4 Hour Work Week, Study Hacks, AJATT, etc. All we need is Day9.
