I haven't stuck with any task managers that I've tried. I _do_ keep track of my tasks because I have such a variety of stuff to remember to do; it's just that I'm a complete vagabond in terms of where that task managing goes on. 

Here's the idea of TaskPlayer:

Convert tasks into “sprints” that optimize energy (e.g. timeboxing on the order of seconds or minutes), automatically schedule them based on due dates, and estimate necessary rate of sprints/day. So when I'm ready to do some work, instead of pulling up my to-do list and figuring out what to do and how to go about it, I simply hit play on the TaskPlayer, and I'm good to go. See attached image (Marxism not intended for irony...).

Principles:

* use shorter sprints when attention is wavering -- get minimal feedback from user (sun/cloud in the image)
* incremental changes (like reps for strength building) - either more done in the same time, shorter time to do the same thing, or building up longer attention span
* avoid planning fallacy
* allow customization for work/play/rest ratio and task consistency; warn when due date requires abnormalities in schedule

Competition:

Had no idea anything like this existed until today, but Vitamin R has a lot of the features: www.publicspace.net/Vitamin-R/
The major thing it doesn't do is scheduling and tracking progress of major projects.

Will be discussed soon.
