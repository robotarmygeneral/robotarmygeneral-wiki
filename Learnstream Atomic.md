LS Atomic is the name of the summer project to build a web app for learning physics. (Atomic because of the focus on individual components of learning.)
 
## Roadmap
 
### Theme
Students who have gone through the LS course not only master basic mechanics, but they know what they know and what to do to maintain their ability. Learnstream is a[n atomic] blast to use because at every point, the user can see him or herself making steps towards mastery.
 
Everything should serve the theme!! 
 
### Three Acts
 
1. Students struggle to solve problems. The problems are comprehensive in covering everything they need to know for calculus-based mechanics. 
2. Students watch videos to understand what knowledge they're missing. 
3. Students track their progress for each component of knowledge. They understand that when all of these components are mastered, they will be able to succeed in physics. 
 
### What's missing?
 
* Students should get constant feedback about how their actions represent progress: earning points, seeing progress bars fill up, etc.
* Students might forget stuff. SRS tries to predict this. But SRS might not be enough: students may need time to absorb even a single component fully. If we break components into sufficiently small pieces---for example, a fact used in a specific context---then we can guarantee transfer. Perhaps we can incorporate chunking to model and display this.
* Students should feel like every video they watch is worth their time. Videos only appear for items that the student missed and cover exactly that item. High probability misconceptions are covered in the video by having a dialog between student and tutor. The problems on the videos should be written on paper but resemble the layout of the web interface to ensure transfer (and vice versa -- make the web interface something that resembles paper solving).
* Like in strength building, students are always forced to go just beyond their ability when solving a problem. They are given enough context to understand exactly what's needed and then take the next step. This may be a more difficult or subtle application or require synthesizing two existing components.
* Meta-cognitive skills are themselves components. Students will understand that they don't need to rely on the framework provided by the system when they are done because they have learned how to determine the goal, focus on major themes, and organize the context and mathematics of problems.
