What is the ideal school (considering both a traditional school or an online community)?

Thoughts:

* "a self-sustaining community of [learning](Learning) and knowledge creation"
* Can we combine collaborative research with learning in a single platform?
* Is the university a good model?
* Trying to establist a theory of [Collaborative Learning]()
* Lectures: University lectures are not really collaborative. Most lectures, I assume, inherit from a textbook and/or a course that the instructor took, maybe a combination of a few sources. There is not really a good enough cross-breeding to evolve the lectures much. Nor is there usually survival except in what was remembered by the attendees. Also, from my experience, discussion in lectures is pretty weak.  
* Textbooks: It'd certainly be unusual to find a textbook with no exercises. But these exercises are usually really slow and difficult, they come from insights of the author and so maybe skip a step necessary to really learn something. Big Algs is pretty interesting because Prof. Ran is basing a lot of stuff on papers and not established textbooks. He is able to generate challenging and thought-provoking assignments but I'm not sure *exactly* what they are helping us learn. It does make us more familiar with the material which is actually a huge thing (first line of Suzuki's book, and basically all of AJATT condensed into one line: "Oh--why, Japanese children can all speak Japanese"). But some of the things have seem to be trying to use things in a totally backwards way of how they would have been discovered. And similarly it seems a lot of the way that we get through difficult problems at Mudd is to be handed a hint that includes what seems like brilliant insight.
* Conferences: The problem with conferences is that there seems to be a problem of matching background knowledge with the content of the talk. 
* Journals: The idea of peer-review seems to be a good system for eliminating noise for signal -- not all of it, certainly. The problem is that it is quite slow. Here is one new idea: http://f1000.com/ One of the ideas for Learnstream is matching up one person's question as another's exercise. Machines can help a bit with the spam and we could possibly reduce this to a very light and fast system. 
* How about this very conservation? It would be good to break down the ideas as questions and construct answers over time through conversations, pulling in more examples (which change over time), making metaphors, etc. This was roughly one goal of [Learnstream Soup]() and may be further address with [Learnstream Glue]()
* Many thoughts about this in [Mindstorms]() by Simon Papert.
* Kindergarteners are awesome: [Build a tower, build a team](http://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower.html)  (a video or book that talked about how young children found more ways to use a physical object than adults; I can't find it!!!!!!) -- the lesson is that schools remove our ability to be freely expressive and use experimentation when we need to (also addressed in [How Children Fail]())
* [Lockhart's Lament](http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_03_08.html) - necessary (but not sufficient?) idea for education of math and other subjects -- must be made interesting by showing the underlying beauty, not just algorithms and facts
* Sal Khan and Andrew Hsu both claim that education is better when ages are mixed
* The semester and midterm exam are arbitrary concepts -- we should be learning things for a lifetime if they are important

Web specific:

* Using blogs: periodic review, "deep" questions i have, predictions, reflection on what i found out <-- blog as scientific method
* Using twitter: random thoughts, may not lead to anything; ask quick questions; propagate links <-- twitter as "real" scientific work
* Using tumblr: an expert on (some unique field or intersection of fields) records observations from a specific topic. E.g. [an exper of philosophy watches the Simpsons](http://www.amazon.com/Simpsons-Philosophy-Homer-Popular-Culture/dp/0812694333)
* hypercrossspecialization for individuals, each keeps blog/twitter/whatever, networks of related items, AI systems to process
* Current problem: too many people are talking about the exact same thing; gossip without any particular perspective or insight
* Motivation is a major issue, which is addressed in this article: http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol10/issue4/ling.html The factors that caused greater contribution were when users were "reminded of their uniqueness" ("You are being contacted to do X because you are like Y") and when they were given specific and challenging goals (One example that comes to mind: "Your profile is 40% complete")
* We should branch off another page for "online communities" in general
