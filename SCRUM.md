SCRUM is an agile development process

Product backlog: wishlist of the features

* Product owner: make sure the right features make it
* Scrum master: product progressing smoothly
* Developers, testers, customers, executives

Release planning, estimate amount of work for each feature (use several experts, variety of techniques)

Sprints - short duration milestones (3-30 days)

4-12 sprints per release

release backlog -> spring backlogs

Burndown charts Play project visibility tool

day-by-day measure of work amount remaining

track bugs separately from features, deal with immediately before marking features complete
