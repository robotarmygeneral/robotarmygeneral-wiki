extensive notes are dumb

highlighting nearly everything is dumb

dialoguing: ask yourself questions about the material

Neal:

> This reminds me of a StudyHacks technique (i think?) that you mentioned... lecturing outloud to yourself as a way of studying solidifies the material because it forces you to translate a mental understanding into actual verbage. I'm guessing this creates some sort of stronger mental link to the material?

questions:

* purpose
* pre-existing knowledge - warms you up

Me and Neal:

> reflected through SRS review before a lesson. will letting students choose which material to review help them prepare moreso than just showing them the cards?

Neal:

> I think so. Although there needs to be balance. Letting them choose material gives them more control, but there are some things which must be reviewed (even if the student isn't so excited about it). Just like balancing your diet... you may not want to eat the vegetables, but it makes for a healthier meal.

> On that note though... i really think that forcing the student at the beginning of the review session to recall key ideas will make the review more "active" and lead to greater understanding. It will also bring topics for possible connection to the front of the student's mind.


* big picture - skim the passage, summarize
* predict what author says - okay if they aren't right; passive->active
* questions an expert would ask
* your own questions - ex: what if.../what does this remind me of; prioritize and answer questions

Neal:
> Is there a way we can build this question technique into something that could be supported by TAs? Although, that is far down the line when it really goes commercial. But if we end up selling this to particular schools, they could hire their own TAs to answer student questions.

* what is important - pareto principle (80% of your learning comes from 20% of the material); continually update notes to reflect

Me:
> semi-related question -- part of what we are doing is attempting to extract the 20% (via flashcards). is that bad though? why hasn't the 80% been evolved out over time? (or maybe it just gets better over time) it kinda goes back to thing in brain rules where you support your memory of something by supplementing it with context and meaning. I guess as long as the context is still there through media syncs, we won't have a problem.

paraphase and summarize

* active involvement by taking notes
* use your own words but copy buzzwords
* write on looseleaf single-sided so you can spread out the sheets to get the big picture

organize

* try different ways of organizing, grouping by characteristics
* find ways to link things (A becomes B by method M)
* organize in table to answer expert/orienting questions

pictures

* use techniques to emphasize relative importance
* simple enough to reconstruct in memory

hook

* understand first - think about how to reconstruct without memorization
* create picture, pattern, rhyme or story
* engage emotions and senses, pay attention to the surrounding and then remember the environment to retrieve the memory

Me:
> it will be fun to do this is in a game environment as discussed a few times, but we could consider letting users associate other things with a flashcard (e.g. have different background environments that we bring up with certain cards) this could all be done through media syncs so that we somehow pull up a big beautiful collage of stuff every time you study a card

* big, big picture - combine and consolidate notes


different subjects

interpretation (e.g. literature)

* read many times to focus on how the author is saying something
* lots of example expert questions and big picture questions, types of diagrams, etc in the book

problem solving (e.g. math)

* imitation comes first, understanding develops over time
* understanding is difficult even if math is logical
* become familiar with notation
* expert questions

      o what would i guess the answer would be
      o what is each step accomplishing
      o what's the pattern
      o if this changes, what else will change
      o what happens at the extremes
      o can i generalize
      o what are special cases
      o how can this question be rephrased
      o essential features of the problem
      o what does this remind me of
      o different ways to solve
      o derive the formula
      o make the concept more tangible

* do lots of problems, one type of problem at a time

Me:
> fuuck i need to do this

Neal:
> Although, it's important to avoid overstudying though, since that time could be better used by spacing the problems out. This, however, would fit into the idea of short (ie, 45 minute or so) study sessions with a break inbetween, unless the problems are too hard to do in 45 minutes (which is possible).

Me:
> trust me, i didn't "overstudy" for the putnam

Neal:
> Haha i guess so. I think that comment is more in response to flashcard (ie, language vocab) studying, where it doesn't pay off in the long run to drill a flashcard several times past understanding instead of stopping after a single successful recall and then reviewing the next day.
