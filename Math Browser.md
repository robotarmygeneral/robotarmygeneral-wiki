Often the hardest part about solving a textbook mathematics problem is looking up all the right definitions and theorems. Furthermore, quick access to this information makes it easier to study for an exam. Is there a way to make a better interface for this? I think so. My initial proposal is something very simple. Search by keyword, narrow down to definitions, theorems, proof outlines, propositions, and/or examples. Each result is listed consisely for easy browsing and can be expanded when clicked.

I think the biggest area for expansion is improving the search and ‘related topics’ (which you may barely be able to make out in the sketch). Ideally (maybe too ideally), if you wanted to prove something about X and Y, start at the definition of X , have things connecting X to Y appear (or maybe X to Z to … to Y), and follow along to trail to basically have the proof written for you. Of course, theorem provers exist, but we want to be promoting education at the same time.
