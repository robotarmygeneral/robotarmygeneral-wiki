Evolearn: a genetic algorithm for masses of human learners

An "education" of a subject consists of an ordered sequence of (question, answer) pairs. Answers can be anything from a short numerical answer to a vague explanation, in text or video or game or whatever. In addition there "exams" that test essential knowledge for a subject.

An instructor creates an initial education for a subject, which, at minimum contains at least one question and at least one exam item.

When a student studies, they are presented with questions, which they can either answer themselves or look at an answer provided by someone else. At some point, a student takes an exam. Based on the performance of the student on the exam, the question sequence and related answers are passed on to new students (or possibly the same student who is reviewing or trying again) with some random mutation.
