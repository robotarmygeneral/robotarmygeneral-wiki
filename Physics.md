# Discussions and feedback 

## Conversation with Saeta

My thought was we could make the "professor approved" cards and answers more distinct, and have a disclaimer that the professors don't endorse the accuracy of student generated cards. We could also make sure to have a feature to "flag" suspect cards or answers, for graders/TA/professors to look through and approve or clarify. Other ideas?

However, we can also say that Prof. Su hasn't seen a decrease in attendance, and students have given feedback that they really like having the lectures online in order to review concepts after lecture and at their own pace!! (this is worth emphasizing... compare Khan's statement that student's don't fail, they are just left behind if they move at a slower pace). Also, it seems there is a lot of evidence to suggest that lecture capture systems do a lot to improve learning outcomes, and Mudd should get on the bandwagon anyways. For large phys. 24/51 style lectures anyways, despite what the professors may think, there isn't much to be gained sitting in galileo vs. sitting in your dorm room (although we shouldn't say it in as many words...)

Should we work on doing a physics-specific demo, since some of the topics in mechanics (say) are more amenable to concept check questions and short(er) exercises which the students could do? We could maybe use some of sahakian's podcast material, too, with those problems.

## Conversation with Lynn

I talked to Prof. Lynn this afternoon, and here are my notes about what she felt frosh were lacking coming in to Mudd:

Comments from Theresa Lynn, April 22nd

She's happy to answer specific questions when they arise/provide materials... but doesn't have the precise vision
and so wasn't sure she could give helpful general feedback.

As to what freshmen are lacking....

Math skills:
	Trigonometry
	Algebra
	Vectors
		taking components in particular; addition, subtraction, dot/cross products, etc.

Generally speaking: a student will come into office hours, you'll put a problem up on the board, and
it will take them a /long/ time to do some simple trig/algebraic or vector manipulation. They simply 
aren't fluent, and have a hard time deciding what to do.


Physics Concepts:
	Newton's third law -- half of students at end of semester still don't understand this
	Centripetal acceleration -- don't understand it is towards the center (problem with vectors..?)
	Force concept inventory questions
	
1d, 2d kinematics are more or less assumed knowledge -- treat them in Phys24 at a theoretical level, but
move very quickly and assume students have seen this in high school and are comfortable with such problems.
	

Math/Physics:
	Centers of Mass
	Moments of Inertia

Have a hard time setting up the integrals.
Have a hard time going from word descriptions to a mathematical description.
	What variables do we need? What is given? What are we trying to find?


GENERAL:
Being good with vectors
Knowing the "tricks" of the trade -- talk to Prof. Sparks
	Example: when to use a sin or a cos? Answer: DONT draw out the triangle and geometer your way to the answer...

Neal:

> Fore example, consider a pendulum, and you want to write the torque exerted by gravity about the pivot. Instead of sitting down and drawing out a triangle, trying to get the angles right based on how you defined them in the problem, etc., you just realize that the torque is maximized at pi/2 and minimized at 0 rad. Thus, you want a sin function.
> 
> Another example might be finding the gravitational force perpendicular to the surface of an inclined plane... again, maximized at pi/2 and minimized at 0 rad, so you'd use sin (not cosine).

Marko:

> I don't see why that's necessarily preferable to a geometric solution. I mean, I've certainly seen some kids just start drawing triangles everywhere when they were trying to solve physics questions, and it took them forever. But, I don't see why it's necessarily wrong. It's not as though sin, cos aren't derived from geometry.

Neal:

> It certainly isn't wrong per se, just inefficient and easy to make mistakes. I've seen a lot of freshmen in AE for tutoring who draw triangles and then mistake one of the legs for the hypotenuse, or mislabel the angle, etc.  If you're really careful about it, drawing triangles will of course give you the right answer, but if you can get the right answer from quickly thinking about whether the function should be maximized or minimized for theta = 0 (for example), it's worth using the shortcut.

Meta-cognitive questions -- what type of problem is this? what types of principles should I apply?


Setting expectations:
	Good study habits and techniques, etc.
	Example: student who was shocked (in a non-physics class) when they did poorly on a midterm after studying stuff
	in the book -- the exam covered the material emphasized in class.

Department's thoughts about physics SI class:
	words --> math (choosing variables, etc.)
	Fermi estimation problems


To look into:
Giancoli Textbook: http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_giancoli_physicsppa_6/

Look at physics placement test (talk to townsend/kathy) to see what types of problems it has
	Lynn estimated about 11-12 (of 36?) were math-related questionsk


Ryan:

> I feel like the best thing to do mega-cognitive-wise is to have them use a really cool system which gets them to do things in a different way (review old material, track progress, read solutions). That's how I got started (the cool system being Anki). 
> 
> But there's plenty more we can do, so feel free to speculate.

Neal:

> Another example where over-thinking in terms of the definition can lead you astray is in calculating torques.  Trying to calculate the torque by doing 
> 
> $$ \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = |r| |F| \sin\theta $$
> 
> is technically correct, but in this case it is easier to look at the problem geometrically and calculate a perpendicular distance between the line of action (drawn through the force) and the point you are taking the torque about. Otherwise, you've got to think carefully about how the angle theta is really defined in the cross product, and how that relates to the angles you have in your problem.  In this case, the geometric approach --> finding r_perpendicular is easier, and then using the idea that cross products "multiply perpendicular components".

> Also:

> In terms of choosing a problem solving strategy, Lynn recommended:

> -- Process problems might have something as function of time, involve F = ma, etc.
